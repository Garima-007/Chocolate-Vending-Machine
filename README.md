# What is it about?
The aim was to design an embedded system which behaves like a choclate vending machine. The user enters the appropriate amount and the machine dispatches the corresponding chocolate. For further details see the pdf.

# Personal contribution
The goal was to design a Chocolate Vending Machine in Proteus using 8086 microprocessor. It had other components
such as a weight sensor implemented using a pressure sensor, a stepper motor to dispense chocolates, an ADC to 
convert analog pressure input, keypad, LEDs, RAM and ROM chips etc. My role was to interface the pressure sensor, 
ADC and stepper motor and implement their functionalities in assembly language.

# Environment
Proteus simulation with assembly program

# How to use it?
Add the ASM file to your proteus simulation and run the simulation code in Proteus.
